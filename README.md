#Garbage Classification API

This is a web API for classifying garbage into 10 categories: metal, glass, Biological, Paper, Battery, Trash, Cardboard, Shoes, Clothes and Plastic.

##Project Overview

This project is a part of the "Introduction to Data Analytics" course group project in the 3rd year of study. The goal of this project is to create a web application where a user can send a picture of garbage to the API server, and the image will be classified using a pre-trained machine learning model. The predicted class will be sent back to the website, which will display the class along with the uploaded image.
